# Blockchain Error and Issue Handling Guide

## How Blockchain Errors Are Detected

### 1. Hash Mismatch Errors
- **Description**: Occurs when the calculated hash of a block doesn't match its stored hash
- **Detection**: System automatically verifies hashes during chain validation
- **Example**: 
  ```
  Block #45: Hash mismatch
  Expected: a1b2c3...
  Actual:   x9y8z7...
  ```

### 2. Broken Chain Errors
- **Description**: When a block's previous_hash doesn't match the hash of the previous block
- **Detection**: During chain traversal in `verify_chain.php`
- **Example**:
  ```
  Chain broken at block #32
  Block #33's previous_hash doesn't match Block #32's hash
  ```

### 3. Data Tampering Indicators
- **Description**: When block data has been altered after creation
- **Detection**: Recalculating and comparing hashes during verification
- **Example**:
  ```
  Data tampering detected in Block #27
  Field 'quantity' was modified from '100' to '200'
  ```

## How to Raise an Issue

### 1. Using the Admin Dashboard
1. Navigate to the Blockchain Audit section
2. Locate the problematic block or transaction
3. Click "Report Issue" button
4. Select issue type and provide details
5. Submit the report

### 2. Common Issue Types
- **Data Integrity**: When data appears incorrect but chain is valid
- **Missing Block**: When expected blocks are missing from the chain
- **Tampering Suspected**: When you suspect unauthorized modifications
- **Performance Issues**: When chain validation is slow or timing out

## How the System Handles Errors

### 1. Automatic Detection
- System runs periodic chain validation
- Email alerts for critical issues
- Logs all verification attempts

### 2. Manual Intervention Required For
- Chain reorganization
- Data recovery
- Block validation overrides

## Best Practices for Handling Blockchain Issues

1. **Document Everything**
   - Take screenshots of error messages
   - Note the block numbers and transaction IDs
   - Record timestamps of when issues were noticed

2. **Verification Steps**
   - Run manual chain verification
   - Check system logs for related errors
   - Verify recent backups

3. **Escalation Path**
   - Minor issues: Log and monitor
   - Major issues: Notify blockchain admin
   - Critical issues: Emergency response team

## Common Error Messages and Their Meanings

| Error Code | Meaning | Action Required |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| BC-101 | Hash Mismatch | Verify block data integrity |
| BC-202 | Broken Chain | Check previous block hashes |
| BC-303 | Invalid Timestamp | Verify system time sync |
| BC-404 | Block Not Found | Check for missing blocks |

## Recovery Procedures

1. **For Single Block Corruption**
   - Restore from backup
   - Rebuild block with valid data
   - Update hashes accordingly

2. **For Chain Splits**
   - Identify the last valid block
   - Rebuild chain from that point
   - Validate all subsequent blocks
